            A science exhibition is typically an event where scientific knowledge, discoveries, and innovations are showcased. It may focus on a specific theme or scientific topic and can involve a wide range of displays, including models, interactive exhibits, demonstrations, and informational posters.
        </p>

        <p>
            Exhibitions are often open to the general public and are meant to educate and engage people in science in a more exploratory way.

        <p>
            There may be multiple exhibits or booths where different projects or inventions are presented. These could be curated by institutions, universities, companies, or schools. It’s not always competitive and could feature more passive viewing, where people can learn about the subject matter.

        <p>
            The goal is usually educational, meant to spark curiosity and inspire interest in science across a broad audience.
