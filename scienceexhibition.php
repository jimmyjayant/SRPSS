        <p>
            A science exhibition is typically an event where scientific knowledge, discoveries, and innovations are showcased. It may focus on a specific theme or scientific topic and can involve a wide range of displays, including models, interactive exhibits, demonstrations, and informational posters.
        </p>

        <p>
            Exhibitions are often open to the general public and are meant to educate and engage people in science in a more exploratory way.
        </p>

        <p>
            There may be multiple exhibits or booths where different projects or inventions are presented. These could be curated by institutions, universities, companies, or schools. Itâ€™s not always competitive and could feature more passive viewing, where people can learn about the subject matter.
        </p>

        <p>
            The goal is usually educational, meant to spark curiosity and inspire interest in science across a broad audience.
